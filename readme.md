# StudyPom

StudyPom is a web-based pomodoro timer app built with TypeScript and React that helps you stay focused and productive during your study sessions. The pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique can help you manage your time effectively, maintain concentration, and avoid burnout.
